# Student Performance
Predict student's future performance using his information like past performance, sex, etc

# Project Flow
1. Lay out Linear model using Pytorch
2. After changing each attribute's value to number type, apply normalization and standardization to data
3. Init weight using xavior function
4. For correct measurement, use bagging of model ensemble
5. To prevent overfitting, add penalty to weight
6. Use cross validation
